# Trainer's configurations  
After startup infrastrucure dockers, you have to start a new docker for the trainer. You can run this docker at the same computer or run at other computer. But remember to put 4 configurations inside the docker's config file after git cloning our repo inside the docker.  
First 3 configurations are all generated by running "Startup_Infrastructures.sh"  
The last configuration is written by yourselve.
